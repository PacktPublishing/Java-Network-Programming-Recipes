## About the Video Course

Java provides numerous classes that have developed over the years to meet evolving networking needs. These range from low-level socket and IP-based approaches to those encapsulated in software services.

 This practical tutorial provides a complete introduction to developing network programs with Java. We start with the basics of networking and then explore how Java supports the development of clients/servers. You’ll explore how to use Java’s network class library to rapidly and effortlessly accomplish common networking tasks such as writing multithreaded servers, network scalability, implementing application protocols, and filtering clients and client names. Java NIO packages are examined as well as multitasking, building hands-on NIO buffers, scatter and gather, and transferring data to channels and selectors.

 By the end of this video tutorial, you will have mastered networking fundamentals (and advanced concepts) in Java to ensure you understand (and are capable of building) networked programs.
